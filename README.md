# Simple Chunkloader [Fabric]

This is a port of the [mod originally made by xZarex](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-chunkloader-fabric) to 1.20.1 for use in LuminaCC

The recipe has been modified to make them not too abundant. They do NOT appear in the creative inventory, they must be given to creative players with `give @s simplechunkloader:chunkloader`
